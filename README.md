**Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game can be played against an AI opponent at two different levels: Easy and Hard.

**Gameplay**

The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking an empty cell with their designated symbol (either 'O' or 'X'). The goal is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your symbols before the opponent does.

**Levels of Difficulty**

The game offers two levels of difficulty:

**Easy**: The AI opponent makes random moves on the board.

**Hard**: The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves. It will try to win if possible or block the player from winning.
When starting the game, the player is prompted to choose the level of difficulty. If an invalid choice is entered, the game defaults to the Easy level.
